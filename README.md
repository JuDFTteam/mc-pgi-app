This is an 'app' collection of jupyter notebooks from the pgi-1
bases on the jupyter app mode developed at empa, CH by Ole schuett.
The empa code was used as an example and quick starting point. Thank you!

Here we collect some ideas, that we do not forget about them

1. Be careful not to dublicate stuff, from other apps, the base apps
2. So far for faster querries information was written into the extras, i.e dublicated in there...
Which I personal do not like, but know after having worked with it... it is easier that way and faster...


Concerning xps spectra app:

What we want is a app that lets you plot spectra and serach the database.
Also the app should suggest you all combinations for a certain stoic.
